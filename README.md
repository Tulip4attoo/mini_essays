# mini_essays

My mini essays folder. I always have a lot of ideas, so I think I’ll try to write here daily—at least, that’s the plan!

These essays should be short, around 150–400 words, so they fit nicely on my screen. I also want to write them quickly, in 20 minutes or less. That means not much referencing, and probably not checking every detail carefully. It’s more about expressing and sharpening my thoughts (and maybe improving my English writing a bit).

Because of this, I might make some mistakes—data, facts, logic, whatever. But that’s fine with me.
