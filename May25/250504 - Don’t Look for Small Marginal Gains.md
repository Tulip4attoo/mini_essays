Some days ago, a young man asked me: have I tried the Feynman method before? I didn’t remember exactly what the Feynman method was, so I had to Google it. The Feynman method heavily involves understanding a topic by expressing it to others, most commonly through teaching.

I have been writing technical pieces for years (it’s been 10 years since I started my GitHub pages, and I’m still writing happily). I don’t really teach other people. But I do think that my frequency of writing is enough for me to understand important topics. And I think that I don’t really need to teach someone else to gain more fluency in the topics I write about. The marginal gain would not be much—maybe 10%, I guess.

We should look for major marginal gains. In software, we should focus on both coding and writing. Each approach can bring significant value to you, and I believe the margin is much more substantial than the difference between writing and teaching.

I think this principle can be applied well in many fields. For example, before GenAI, changing IDEs brought only minor productivity gains (unless you were using Notepad to code). But AI-powered IDEs can bring a major productivity boost, so you should consider making a change. However, once you have chosen one AI IDE tool (or extension, such as Cline or Roo), the margin between them is minor. Of course, we could be wrong, but the risk and reward don’t seem worth it.

I do think that the final thing to consider is when you’ve maxed out everything else, or when the cost of gaining something new is virtually free. For example, carbon shoes may only give runners a 5–10% advantage, but elite athletes should wear them in races. Or creatine might make us slightly stronger, and the cost is so low that we should use it.

But most of the time, don’t look for small marginal gains. Prioritize the major ones.
Chase 10× gains; ignore 5 % hacks unless they’re free.
