Peak is one of the best books I've read. In 2022, I read it for the first time and fell in love with it. In 2025, I read it the second time and loved it even more.

The author asks a question: what brings the genius? Could we humans, most of us, have the capability of insane potential like geniuses?

I have a hypothesis: maybe, if we could know the representation of the pattern the geniuses using, we could reach their level.

Why? Because in some fields—where all necessary skills have been well researched for hundreds of years, like violin playing in the book—the only thing that separates them is training time. There are three tiers: the greatest have thousands more hours than the very good; the very good have thousands more hours than the good. Maybe I should read the research and get the raw data to make a better judgment.

About belief, I think we are all human, and there is not much difference between us. In most cases, if you don’t have some disease or gene problem, we have almost the same capability—at least to reach the 1% level.

This is mathematically wrong, because if everyone tries, not all can get into the top 1%. But in the real world, most don’t try, and some try but not hard enough.

To get better in this era, we all know where to start: just ask ChatGPT (much better than Google, but Google is still OK). But who will start? And how committed are they? In many fields, being great is simple but hard. You must endure the long and boring process day by day, for hundreds or even thousands of days.

How could we do this? I believe it needs courage and love. Courage to accept that we still have many flaws. Courage to change and get better. Love to endure the pain of the boring process. Love gives you the reason to continue. What to love is not important.

Most people don’t have this. But if you want to get better, to become great, you need these two: courage and love.
