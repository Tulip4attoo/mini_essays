- **Why constraints aren’t optional** A universe without scarcity would erase evolutionary incentives; in _that_ universe decision mechanisms might be ornamental. In ours, constraint is the sculptor of cognition.

Because our universe has scarcity.

Organisms that _incorporate_ these constraints into their decision mechanism (fast heuristics when stakes are low, planning when time/energy allow) outperform both rocks and hyper‑rational but slow mutants.

Many dont need a decision mechanism. Rock is still fine.
